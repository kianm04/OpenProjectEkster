<!--
   There may be times when you need to create a component that has Form-field like behavior or visuals,
   but that does not use the Primer Forms API (i.e. components that extend
   `ApplicationComponent`/`ViewComponent::Base` rather than `Primer:Forms::Dsl::Input`).
   In such cases, you can use `AttributeLabelComponent` directly.
   For captions you can use `OpenProject::Common::AttributeHelpTextCaptionComponent`.
   Please have a look at the pattern page for AttributeHelpTexts.
   -->

<%=
  render OpenProject::Common::AttributeHelpTextCaptionComponent.new(help_text:)
