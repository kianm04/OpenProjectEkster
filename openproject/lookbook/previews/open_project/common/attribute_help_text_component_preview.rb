              Find something **useful** to say about this project!

              #### Guidance

              The Project name should be concise and describe the project in terms that are understood by all involved.

              _Good examples_

              - 🧹 Spree Cleanup Project
              - 🦦 Thames Sewage Mitigation Project
              - 🏊🏼‍♀️ Public Swimming in the Seine

              _Bad examples_

              - 🔥 Stakeholder-Alignment Mega-Project
              - ✈️ New Airport for Berlin
            MARKDOWN
          )
