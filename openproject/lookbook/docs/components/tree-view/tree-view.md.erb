This TreeView component is currently an internal implementation for OpenProject. It nevertheless follows the requirements that Primer has set up for their [(react) TreeView](https://primer.style/product/components/tree-view/) as closely as possible.

## Overview

<%= embed OpenProject::Common::TreeViewPreview, :default %>

## Anatomy

![Tree view anatomy](<%= image_path("lookbook/tree_view_anatomy.png") %>)

Basically, we follow Primer's specification of a TreeView:

1. Parent node: Expands/collapses to show/hide child nodes
2. End node: A node with no children (internally called "leaf")
3. Chevron: Expands/collapses a parent node and indicates expanded/collapsed state
4. Nesting level indicator lines: Each line represents a level of nesting depth
5. Leading action (optional): An IconButton to allow interaction with the node besides activating or expanding
6. Leading visual (optional): A visual cue for additional context
7. Node label: The text label for the node
8. Trailing visual (optional): Same as a leading visual, but placed to the right of all other element

### Multi-select

In addition to Primer's guidelines, we introduced an option called `select_variant` which can either be

* `none` (default)
* `single`: When `single` is chosen, one item can be selected. The selection is indicated via an arrow in the slot of the trailing visual
* `multiple`: When `multiple` is chosen, there is a checkbox rendered between the leading action and the leading visual to afford multi-selection

Further, in multi-select mode, a `selection_strategy` can also be configured. This determines the influence checking a parent has on its children:

* `descendants` (default): Checking a parent will automatically select all children. Subsequently deselecting any child will then leave the parent in a so called "mixed" state
* `self`: Checking a parent does not affect the children (and vice-versa); every leaf or node behaves independently of others

<%= embed OpenProject::Common::TreeViewPreview, :multi_select, panels: %i[params] %>

### Loading strategies

We support two loading strategies:

* static (default): All items are loaded when the component is rendered
* dynamic: Sub-nodes are loaded from the server as soon as a node is expanded. Please note, that this option is currently not available in combination with the `select_variant: :multiple` or `select_variant: :single`.

For more examples have a look [here](../../../inspect/primer/alpha/tree_view/loading_skeleton).

### FileTreeView

There is a special component called `FileTreeView` which is a pre-configured `TreeView` for the use case of showing a file hierarchy. For more information, have a look at the [detailed examples here](../../../inspect/primer/alpha/file_tree_view/default).

<%= embed OpenProject::Common::TreeViewPreview, :file_tree, panels: %i[params source] %>

## Best practices

**Do**
- Use the simplest component as far possible ('self' selection strategy, static loading strategy)
- Before using a basic TreeView with multi-select, check if related components like FilterableTreeView are more suited to your use case

**Don't**

- Don't use multi-select mode with a dynamic loading strategy; multi-select requires static loading

## Used in

* The details view of a hierarchy CustomField

## Examples

For detailed examples have a look at the other [preview examples](../../../inspect/primer/alpha/tree_view/playground) of the component.

Please check out also the [playground for the individual items](../../../inspect/primer/alpha/tree_view/leaf_node_playground).

This is an exemplary playground of the `Primer::Alpha::TreeView`.
