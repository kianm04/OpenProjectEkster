This document describes the available loading indicators in our application and outlines when and how to use them appropriately.

Currently supported loading components:

- `Primer::Alpha::SkeletonBox`
- `Primer::Beta::Spinner`
- `LoadingIndicator` ⚠️ **Deprecated**

---

## SkeletonBox

### Description

`SkeletonBox` displays a rectangular placeholder with a subtle shimmering animation moving from left to right. Width and height can be configured. Multiple `SkeletonBox` elements can be arranged side-by-side or stacked vertically.

This component is ideal for visually representing the structure of content that is currently loading.

<%= embed OpenProject::Common::LoadingIndicatorsPreview, :skeleton_box %>

### When to Use

Use `SkeletonBox` when:

- You know the approximate layout of the content to be loaded.
- You want to avoid layout shifts after content loads.
- You're loading a larger block of content (e.g., cards, list items, sections).

### Example Use Case

* Loading activity entries in the activity tab
* Loading the notifications in notification center

## Spinner

### Description

`Spinner` is a small circular loading indicator with a continuous spinning animation.

<%= embed OpenProject::Common::LoadingIndicatorsPreview, :spinner %>

### When to Use

Use `Spinner` when:

- The content being loaded is bound within a small container
- The content layout is not known at all
- You're waiting for a server response without a visual response to show (eg. content will not be replaced)

### Example Use Case

* Use a Spinner inside a search input field while fetching suggestions from the server.

### LoadingIndicator (Deprecated)

⚠️ **Do not use** ⚠️

<%= embed OpenProject::Deprecated::LoadingIndicatorPreview, :default %>

The LoadingIndicator component was implemented in Angular and is now considered deprecated.

It does not conform to current design or technical standards. All usages should be replaced with either `SkeletonBox` or `Spinner` depending on context.
