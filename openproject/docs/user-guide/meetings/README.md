# Meeting management

Meetings in OpenProject allow you to manage and document your project meetings, prepare a meeting agenda together with your team, and share minutes with attendees - all in one central place.

<div class="glossary">

**Meetings** is defined as a module that allows the organization of meetings.
**Note:** In order to be able to use the meetings plugin, the **Meetings module needs to be activated** in the [Project Settings](../projects/project-settings/modules/).

</div>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> With OpenProject 13.1 we introduced dynamic meetings alongside classic meetings.
> With OpenProject 15.3 dynamic meetings are replaced by [one-time meetings](one-time-meetings) and [recurring meetings](recurring-meetings) to further improve meeting management.
> With OpenProject 16.0 classic meetings were removed from OpenProject.

## Meetings in OpenProject

Meetings in OpenProject help teams organize discussions, track meeting agendas, and document decisions efficiently. There are two types of meetings: **one-time meetings** and **recurring meetings**. [One-time meetings](one-time-meetings/) are standalone events scheduled for a specific date and time. [Recurring meetings](recurring-meetings/) introduce a structured way to define a series of related meetings, ensuring consistency and reducing manual setup.

### Meetings overview

By selecting **Meetings** in the project menu on the left, you get an overview of all the meetings you have been invited to within a specific project sorted by date. By clicking on a meeting name you can view further details of the meeting.

To get an overview of the meetings across multiple projects, you can select **Meetings** in the [global modules menu](../../user-guide/home/global-modules/).

![Select meetings module from openproject global modules ](openproject_userguide_meetings_module_select.png)

Meetings will be grouped based on the meeting start time into the following groups:

- **Today** lists open meetings scheduled for the same day

- **Tomorrow** lists open meetings scheduled for the day after

- **Later this week** lists all open meetings scheduled between two days from now till the end of the week 

- **Next week and later** lists all open meetings scheduled the next week and later

### Meetings filters

The menu on the left will allow you to filter meetings based on following:

- **My meetings** lists all meetings you participate in
- **Recurring meetings** lists all recurring meetings visible to you
- **All meetings** lists all meetings visible to you
- **Meeting series** lists meeting occurrences that are part of recurring meetings
- **Invitations** lists all meetings you are invited to
- **Attended** lists all meetings in which you were marked as having attended
- **Created by me** lists all meetings created by you

The buttons next to *Filters* will allow you to filter for upcoming or past meetings.

You can also use the meetings filters to refine the list of meetings based on the following criteria: 

- **Attended user** - shows meetings that a specific user attended

- **Author** - shows meetings that a specific user created

- **Invited user** - shows meetings that a specific user was invited to

- **Part of a meeting series** - shows meetings that are part of specific meeting series

- **Project** - shows meetings for a specific project (this will only be displayed in the global module view, i.e. not within a specific project)

### Subscribe to meetings

You can subscribe to all your OpenProject meetings in an external calendar application (such as Outlook, Apple Calendar, or Open-Xchange). This provides a single, read-only calendar that stays up to date automatically, without relying on individual .ics email invites.

#### Create a subscription

You can subscribe to OpenProject meetings either within the *Meetings* module, or from your [Account settings page](../account-settings/#icalendar). 

On the meetings overview page (either global or project specific) click the **More (three dots)** icon and select **Subscribe to calendar**. 

![Button to subscribe to meetings calendar on OpenProject meetings overview page](openproject_userguide_meetings_subscribe_button.png)

You will be guided through creating an iCal subscription token:
1. Name the token and click **Create subscription**.

![New calendar subscription form opened in OpenProject](openproject_userguide_meetings_subscribtion_form_name.png)

2. Copy the generated iCal meeting subscription URL. This URL is shown only once and allows anyone with it to view your meetings.

![iCal meeting subscription URL shown when subscribing to a meetings calendar in OpenProject](openproject_userguide_meetings_subscription_token.png)

3. Add this URL to your external calendar to subscribe to your OpenProject meetings.

If you are only interested in a specific meeting, you can [download that specific meeting as an iCal event]
(/one-time-meetings/#download-a-meeting-as-an-icalendar-event/) instead.
