  description: Returns a collection of programs. The collection can be filtered via
    query parameters similar to how work packages are filtered. In addition to the
    provided filter, the result set is always limited to only contain programs the
    client is allowed to see.
  parameters:
    - name: filters
      schema:
        type: string
      in: query
      required: false
      description: |-
        JSON specifying filter conditions.
        Accepts the same format as returned by the [queries](https://www.openprogram.org/docs/api/endpoints/queries/) endpoint.
        Currently supported filters are:

        + active: based on the active property of the program
        + ancestor: filters programs by their ancestor. A program is not considered to be its own ancestor.
        + available_project_attributes: filters programs based on the activated project attributes.
        + created_at: based on the time the program was created
        + favorited: based on the favorited property of the program
        + id: based on programs' id.
        + latest_activity_at: based on the time the last activity was registered on a program.
        + name_and_identifier: based on both the name and the identifier.
        + parent_id: filters programs by their parent.
        + principal: based on members of the program.
        + project_phase_any: based on the project phases active in a program.
        + project_status_code: based on status code of the program
        + storage_id: filters programs by linked storages
        + storage_url: filters programs by linked storages identified by the host url
        + type_id: based on the types active in a program.
        + user_action: based on the actions the current user has in the program.
        + visible: based on the visibility for the user (id) provided as the filter value. This filter is useful for admins to identify the programs visible to a user.

        There might also be additional filters based on the custom fields that have been configured.

        Each defined lifecycle step will also define a filter in this list endpoint. Given that the elements are not
        static but rather dynamically created on each OpenProject instance, a list cannot be provided. Those filters follow the schema:
        + project_start_gate_[id]: a filter on a project phase's start gate active in a program. The id is the id of the phase the gate belongs to.
        + project_finish_gate_[id]: a filter on a project phase's finish gate active in a program. The id is the id of the phase the gate belongs to.
        + project_phase_[id]: a filter on a project phase active in a program. The id is the id of the phase queried for.
      example: '[{ "ancestor": { "operator": "=", "values": ["1"] }" }]'
    - name: sortBy
      schema:
        type: string
      in: query
      required: false
      description: |-
        JSON specifying sort criteria.
        Currently supported orders are:

        + id
        + name
        + typeahead (sorting by hierarchy and name)
        + created_at
        + public
        + latest_activity_at
        + required_disk_space

        There might also be additional orders based on the custom fields that have been configured.
      example: '[["id", "asc"]]'
    - name: select
      schema:
        type: string
      in: query
      required: false
      description: |-
        Comma separated list of properties to include.
      example: 'total,elements/identifier,elements/name'
