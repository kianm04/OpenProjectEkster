# Time and costs

Navigate to *Administration* -> *Time and costs*. Here you can configure costs in OpenProject and create cost types to track unit costs. Also, you can configure the currency you want to use for your cost reports.

## Default time and cost settings

To define default settings for logging time and costs navigate to *Administration* -> *Time and costs* -> *Defaults* and select *Time* or *Costs* tab respectively.

### Define default time settings (Enterprise add-on)

[feature: time_entry_time_restrictions ]

Under the *Time* tab you can define which fields are required to be fill out when logging time across all projects. 

- **Allow exact times tracking**: enables entering start and finish times when logging time.  If disabled, only the amount of time spent can be logged, but not the start or end times. 
  
  If this option is activated, calendar mode is shown by default under My time tracking page. If not, list view will be shown by default.
  
- **Require exact times**: makes entering start and finish times mandatory when logging time.

## Create and manage cost types

You can create and manage **cost types** to [book unit costs to work packages in OpenProject](../../user-guide/time-and-costs/cost-tracking/).

Click the green **+ Cost type** button to create a new cost type.

You can set the following options:

1. Enter a **name** for the cost type.
2. Define the **unit name** for this cost type, e.g. Euro, piece, day, etc.
3. Set the **pluralized unit name**, e.g. Euros, pieces, days, etc.
4. Choose if the cost type should be the **default cost type** when booking new unit costs.
5. Define the Rate history and **set a date** from which this cost type should be valid and **set a rate** (in the specified unit) for this date.
6. With the + icon you can add **additional rates for other dates**.
7. The delete icon will **remove a rate** for a certain date.
8. Do not forget to **save** your changes.

> With cost types you can also book any kind of units to work packages, e.g. vacation days, leaves, travel days, etc.. Just choose 1 as a unit.
