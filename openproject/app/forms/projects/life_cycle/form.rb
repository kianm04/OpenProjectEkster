      # Do not show the native datepicker on iOS safari because it
      # behaves totally different than all other browsers and destroys the behavior of the datepicker
      # Given a date field with no value: When Safari opens its native datepicker, the first thing it does is to
      # set the date to Today. And not only in the datepicker but directly in the field.
      # This behaviour has however consequences:
      # * The "reset" button in the datepicker does not clear the input (as the other browsers do it) but it resets
      #   it to the original value it had when you opened it. So if the value was empty, it sets it back to empty.
      #   If the value was set before, you cannot clear it, but only set it back to that value.
      # * Since the input changes, the whole datepicker updates without the user even knowing about it,
      #   since the form is hidden behind the datepicker. That leads to this:
      #     when you enter a start date after today, and then open the datepicker for finish date,
      #     it will reset the start date because the finish date is set automatically to today,
      #     but the finish date can't be before the start date.

    # N.B. This is an inelegant, and very likely brittle solution.
    #
    # The Browser gem uses `helper_method(:browser)` to declare a
    # controller method as a helper. This helper is available in classic
    # Rails views, but since upgrading to ViewComponent 4.0, no longer
    # works with Primer Forms.
