    # JOIN statement for project phase definitions. We ensure that only active project phases are considered.
    # Note that one project might have an active phase while another project has set the phase with the same definition
    # to inactive. Additionally, the permissions to view project phases are considered on a project level, too.

      # The project is joined here anew which should not be necessary for many use-cases but is.
      # The necessity comes from AR's behavior of automatically determining the alias for tables LEFT JOINed via includes.
      # To avoid conflicts, AR will search strings for occurrences of the table name and if found, an included table
      # will be aliased (potentially with a numbering). In this case, if the permission checks are part of the query,
      # it will include a reference to the projects table. Therefore, the include for projects, which happens in
      # the query itself, will be considered needing an alias. That assumption is wrong in this case as the reference
      # to projects is in a subquery but AR does not know that.
