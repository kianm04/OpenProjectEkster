# In the context of the baseline-comparison feature, this class represents an active-record relation
# that queries historic data, i.e. performs its query e.g. on the `work_package_journals` table
# rather than the `work_packages` table.
#
# Usage:
#
#     timestamp = 1.year.ago
#     active_record_relation = WorkPackage.where(subject: "Foo")
#     historic_relation = Journable::HistoricActiveRecordRelation.new(active_record_relation, timestamp:)

  # Patch the arel object, which is used to construct the sql query, in order
  # to modify the query to search for historic data.
  #
  # The way this is done is by prepending a CTE to the list of possible already defined CTEs
  # under the name of the model the historic data is queried on. The CTE will then be on the
  # join of:
  # * the model's data journal (for the property values at the time)
  # * the journals table itself (for the update timestamp)
  # * the model table (for the creation timestamp)
  # The result is that all later statements, including later CTEs, will pick up data from that
  # first CTE. This makes the fact that data is fetched not from the model but from the journals
  # transparent so most queries that work on the model table just continue to work on the journals
  # join. The only currently known exceptions to this are conditions on custom fields. That is
  # because those should also work on the historic data and not the current one, so the statement
  # needs to be rewritten.
  #
  # A statement on work packages might then look like this:
  #
  # WITH work_packages AS (
  #     [SQL join on work_package_journals, journals and work_packages]
  #   ),
  #   other_cte AS ([...with a FROM work_packages...])
  #
  # SELECT * from work_packages
