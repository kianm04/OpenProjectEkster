module Relations::Scopes
  module Visible
    extend ActiveSupport::Concern

    class_methods do
      # Returns all relationships visible to the user. The relationships have to be:
      #   * Start (from_id) on a work package visible to the user (view_work_packages in the work package's project)
      #   * End (to_id) on a work package visible to the user (view_work_packages in the work package's project)
      #
      # In some cases, the resulting SQL query as is might not run in a performant matter. This happens in
      # cases where there are a lot of work packages and relations. PostgreSql then sometimes chooses to use a
      # full table scan on work_packages expecting a lot of results.
      # Then, the query can be optimized by providing a +work_package_focus_scope+ which is used as a subquery
      # on work_packages on the id column. This is beneficial if not all work packages are to be
      # considered but only a subset. As this directly excludes work packages, it can also be used
      # the wrong way.

      # @param [ActiveRecord::Relation, Arel::SelectManager] work_package_focus_scope
