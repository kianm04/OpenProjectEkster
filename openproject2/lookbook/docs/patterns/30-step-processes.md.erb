There are two approaches to guiding the user through a step-by-step approach:

* `StepWizard`
* `StepConfiguration`

The key difference is that `StepWizard` is used to guide end users through a specific process usually related to project actions and the `StepConfiguration` is used in settings pages to guide admins through a configuration process.

## StepWizard

A `StepWizard` is used to provide a user a focused, guided and step-by-step interface to complete a complex process.
A good example is completing a Project Initiation Request, which involves filling out a lot of information.

`StepWizard` pages differ from standard application pages:

* They are centered on the screen.
* Their content has a maximum width
* Navigation actions (Back, Continue, Cancel, Submit) are grouped in a dedicated footer region.

To support this UI pattern, two dedicated ViewComponents are available:

* `StepWizard::PageLayout` — defines the structure and layout of a wizard page.
* `StepWizard::Footer` — renders the wizard footer, including navigation controls and progress information.

### StepWizard::PageLayout

The PageLayout component provides the structural layout for each wizard step. It defines three content regions:

* page_header — Optional header or title area
* wizard_content — Main page content (form, text, etc.)
* footer — Footer area for wizard navigation (usually contains StepWizard::FooterComponent)

It also applies the standard wizard styling, such as maximum width and centered alignment.

<%= embed OpenProject::StepWizard::PageLayoutPreview, :default, panels: %i[] %>

For detailed examples have a look at the other [wizard layout preview examples](/lookbook/inspect/OpenProject/StepWizard/page_layout/default).

### StepWizard::Footer

The Footer component renders the navigation area of the wizard and displays the user’s progress.

The footer layout includes:

* Back button (optional, hidden on the first step)
* Progress bar (optional)
* Cancel button (optional)
* Continue button (shown when the current step is not the last one)
* Submit button (shown on the final step)

<%= embed OpenProject::StepWizard::FooterPreview, :default, panels: %i[] %>

## StepConfiguration

`StepConfiguration` is a UI pattern used to guide administrators through a multi-step configuration process inside a single settings page.

Whereas the `StepWizard` guides end users through a linear sequence of pages, the StepConfiguration focuses on administrative workflows where:

* All steps are on a single page.
* Steps are visually separated into collapsible boxes.
* Only one step is expanded at a time — the active step.
* Completed steps remain visible but collapsed.
* Users progress by completing the currently expanded step, after which the next one automatically opens.

This makes StepConfiguration ideal for settings pages or multi-part configuration flows where context from previous or future steps should remain visible, without requiring page navigation.

### When to Use StepConfiguration

Use StepConfiguration when the workflow has these characteristics:

* It is part of an admin configuration section.
* Steps are logically sequential but do not require page transitions.
* The user benefits from having previous and upcoming steps visible at the same time.
* Steps should be grouped into clearly separated sections (cards/boxes).
* Only one section should be interactively open at a time.

Do not use StepConfiguration for user-facing tasks that require focused form completion. For those, use `StepWizard` instead.
