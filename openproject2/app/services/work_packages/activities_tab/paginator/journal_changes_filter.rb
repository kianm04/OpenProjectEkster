# SQL-based heuristic to filter journals with changes.
#
# Includes journals that have:
#   * Initial journal (version = 1) - always included
#   * Attachment changes (compares attachable_journals with predecessor)
#   * Custom field changes (compares customizable_journals with predecessor)
#   * File link changes (compares storages_file_links_journals with predecessor)
#   * Cause metadata (system-triggered changes)
#   * Attribute/data changes (compares work_package_journals columns with immediate predecessor)
#
# This heuristic compares association records with the predecessor journal to detect actual changes,
# not just the presence of snapshot records.
