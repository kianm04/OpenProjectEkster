        description: This allows you to test your regular expression pattern against sample data to verify that the group names you want extracted are indeed extracted properly. You can modify your pattern here but the test string and matches themselves will not be saved with the configuration.
        group_names_label: Test group names
        group_names_description: Enter one group name per line as it would appear in the OIDC claim, to see how your regular expression patterns affect them.
        show_button: Test pattern
        title: Test regular expressions
    instructions:
      endpoint_url: The endpoint URL given to you by the OpenID Connect provider
      group_regexes: One regular expression pattern per line. Please read [the documentation](docs_url) for more information on how to do this.
      group_regexes_detail: Optionally define patterns using regular expressions to match group names from the groups claim. For example, entering a pattern like <code>^Level1/Level2/([\w/]+)$</code> will extract the group “Groupname/SubGroup” from a response including “Level1/Level2/GroupName/SubGroup”. If no pattern matches, the group is ignored. Leave empty to synchronize all groups using their full group name.
      group_regexes_testing: "Click on 'Test pattern' to test your regular expression pattern against sample OIDC userinfo."
      group_sync: Automatically extract and synchronise group membership information from the identity provider.
      groups_claim: Specify the name of the claim that's expected to indicate the group names that the user is a member of.
