# Adds image/webp to the list of content types Active Storage considers as an image
# Prevents automatic conversion to a fallback PNG, and assumes clients support WebP, as they support gif, jpeg, and png.
# This is possible due to broad browser support for WebP, but older browsers and email clients may still not support
# WebP. Requires imagemagick/libvips built with WebP support.

# Enable validation of migration timestamps. When set, an ActiveRecord::InvalidMigrationTimestampError
# will be raised if the timestamp prefix for a migration is more than a day ahead of the timestamp
# associated with the current time. This is done to prevent forward-dating of migration files, which can
# impact migration generation and other migration commands.
#
# Applications with existing timestamped migrations that do not adhere to the
# expected format can disable validation by setting this config to `false`.
