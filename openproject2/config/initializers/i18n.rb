# Adds fallback to default locale for untranslated strings. Useful for instance
# during development when adding new strings and using another locale than
# English. For production, that's less useful as files downloaded from Crowdin
# already contain fallback English translations.
#
# Also we can't completly remove the fallback mechanism: we still need the it to
# get translated versions of email header and footer as they are supplied by the
# admins and may not be provided for all configured languages. (See
# `Setting#localized_emails_header` and `Setting#localized_emails_footer`.)
