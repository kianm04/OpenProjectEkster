    # Create work packages and relations from a visual chart representation.

    #
    #   create_table(<<~TABLE)
    #     hierarchy   | work |
    #     parent      |   1h |
    #       child     | 2.5h |
    #     another one |      |
    #   TABLE

    #
    #   create(:work_package, subject: 'parent', estimated_hours: 1)
