  Portfolios are one of the types of [workspaces](https://www.openproject.org/docs/api/endpoints/workspaces) in OpenProject structuring the information (e.g. work packages, wikis) into smaller sets. They are typically used to group, structure and manage sub-portfolios, programs and projects that
  target similar strategic goals of the organization. 

  As containers, they also control behaviour of the elements within them. One of the most important aspects of this is that portfolios limit permissions by having members with a certain permission set (roles) assigned to them.

  Depending on custom fields defined for portfolios, additional links might exist.

  Note, that the parent and ancestor links may contain the "undisclosed uri" `urn:openportfolio-org:api:v3:undisclosed` in case an
  ancestor portfolio is defined but the client lacks permission to see it. See the
  [general introduction into links' properties](https://www.openportfolio.org/docs/api/basic-objects/#local-properties) for more information.
