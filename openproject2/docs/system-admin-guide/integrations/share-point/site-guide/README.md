## Configure the Integration permissions on the SharePoint Site

You will need to grant the `manage` permission to the Azure Application so that the integration can work.

### Authentication and permission

To communicate with the GRAPH API you need to authenticate against it. This is done through an Azure application defined in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) for your Microsoft Entra ID.

### API Endpoints

Once you have an access token, as a Site Admin, you will be able to check the site permissions using the following endpoints:

> The current documentation for setting permissions on a SharePoint site can also be found at the [Microsoft Graph API documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/site-post-permissions?view=graph-rest-1.0&tabs=http)

```shell
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/sites/<SHAREPOINT HOSTNAME>:/sites/<SITE NAME>:/permissions
```

Then you will need to grant access to the Azure Application by sending the following JSON:

```json
{
  "roles": ["manage"],
  "grantedToIdentities": [{
    "application": {
      "id": "<AZURE APPLICATION ID>",
      "displayName": "<AZURE APPLICATION NAME>"
    }
  }]
}
```
To the same URL above but as a POST request

```shell
POST https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/sites/<SHAREPOINT HOSTNAME>:/sites/<SITE NAME>:/permissions

```
