# Integrations and Community plugins

There are various integrations and Community plugins out there. Please [contact us](https://www.openproject.org/contact/) if you want to have your plugin to be added to this list.

If you have previously worked with other tools and want to switch or need an integration to OpenProject, there is a way to do so for some applications.

## OpenProject integrations

OpenProject offers integrations with a variety of tools to streamline your workflows and extend platform capabilities. These integrations are maintained and supported by the OpenProject team to ensure compatibility and stability.

> edition is easy and helps support OpenProject.

## Community plugins

Community plugins are developed and maintained by third parties or community contributors.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> These tools are not officially integrated with OpenProject. We do not guarantee full compatibility or error-free usage. Use of these workarounds is at your own risk. 

### Excel

Find out more about the [Excel synchronization with OpenProject](./excel-synchronization).

### JIRA

We do not provide a direct integration between OpenProject and JIRA ourselves. 

If you want to migrate from JIRA to OpenProject, there are several ways to do that, including OpenProject [API](../../api/), OpenProject [Excel sync](excel-synchronization) or using a [Markdown export app](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1221351/markdown-exporter-for-confluence). 

Keep in mind that we are [developing a dedicated OpenProject migration solution](https://community.openproject.org/projects/jira-migration). In the meantime our partners at [ALM Toolbox](https://www.almtoolbox.com/) are happy to support you with Jira or Confluence migration. 

Please consult [JIRA migration overview page](../../installation-and-operations/jira-migration/) for an in-depth overview of all existing options.

### Microsoft Project

To move tasks from MS Project to OpenProject, you can export your MS Project file to Excel and then [synchronize it with OpenProject]( ./excel-synchronization/).

### Timesheet

Currently, there is no direct integration between OpenProject and Timesheet. If you are looking for a time tracking tool with a simple push of a button, consider the integration with [Toggl](../../user-guide/time-and-costs/time-tracking/toggl-integration/).

### Trello

Currently, there is no direct integration between OpenProject and Trello. To synchronize tasks from Trello to OpenProject, export your tasks from Trello into an Excel file and then import these tasks via an [Excel plugin into OpenProject](./excel-synchronization).
