# OpenProject 16.4.0

Release date: 2025-09-10

We released [OpenProject 16.4.0](https://community.openproject.org/versions/2211). The release contains several bug fixes and we recommend updating to the newest version. In these Release Notes, we will give an overview of important feature changes and important technical changes. At the end, you will find a complete list of all changes and bug fixes. 

## Important feature changes

Take a look at our release video showing the most important features introduced in OpenProject 16.4.0:

![Release video of OpenProject 16.4](https://openproject-docs.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/videos/OpenProject_16_4_release.mp4)

### Option to automatically sync the color mode with operating system preference

Users can now enable **automatic color mode** under *Account settings → Interface* to match OpenProject’s color mode with their operating system (OS) preference. When enabled, OpenProject automatically switches between light and dark modes based on the OS setting. Please note that your operating system must also be set to automatic switching.

> [!NOTE]
> If a user has enabled dark mode — either by default or through automatic switching — this overrides the instance’s design settings for that user.

[Learn more about the *Look and feel* options in OpenProject](../../user-guide/account-settings/#look-and-feel).

#### Dark high contrast mode for improved accessibility

Together with the automatic color mode, we have introduced a dark high contrast mode, in addition to the already existing light high contrast mode. This improves readability for users who need stronger visual contrast and enhances accessibility.

> [!NOTE]
> If your OS is set to use high contrast and you enable the new **automatic color mode**, OpenProject will automatically switch to **light high contrast or dark high contrast** accordingly.

### PDF export of project lists

Project managers can now export project lists as PDFs. This makes it easy to create structured reports of all projects without duplicating information.

The exported PDF includes:

- A table of contents with the hierarchy of all exported projects (if more than one project is included).
- A cover page for clear presentation.
- Projects indexed according to their hierarchy (e.g. 1, 1.1, 1.2).
- All selected attributes from the project list, shown in the same order as in the table.
- Section titles linked to the respective project in OpenProject.

To export a project list, open the **More (three dots)** menu in the top right corner of the list and select Export. In the export modal, you can choose between XLS, CSV, or PDF. [Read more about project lists in our documentation](../../user-guide/projects/project-lists/#export-project-lists).

![Screenshot of OpenProject 16.4: Export modal for PDF export of project lists, choosing the file format - XLS, CSV and PDF](openproject-16-4-export-project-list-highlighted.png)

### Custom fonts for all PDF exports (Enterprise add-on)

Administrators for the Enterprise Basic plan and higher can now upload a custom font to be used in all PDF exports. This makes it possible to comply with organization-specific requirements, such as corporate design guidelines.

A new section has been added under *Administration → Design → PDF export font* where administrators can:

- Upload one font family in TTF format (regular required; bold, italic, and bold italic optional).
- Remove previously uploaded fonts.
- Generate a preview PDF to test the uploaded font.

Once uploaded, the font is applied to **all future PDF exports across the instance**.

![Screenshot of OpenProject 16.4: Administration / Design / PDF export font - options to upload fonts for regular, bold and italic and generate Demo PDF](openproject-16-4-pdf-export-font-highlighted.png)

### Improved meeting participants dialog

The meeting participants dialog has been redesigned to make managing participants easier and more efficient. Two major improvements have been added:

#### 1. Autocomplete and multi-select for inviting users

When preparing a meeting agenda, you can now search and select participants using an **autocomplete** field. This is especially helpful in projects with many members.

#### 2. Simplified attendance tracking

If the meeting is set to *In progress*, a **toggle switch next to each participant lets you mark attendance directly**. You can also use a header action to 'Mark all as attended'.

Other meetings improvements include:

- Consistent design with the sharing dialog for work packages.
- Ability to remove participants directly from the dialog.
- Cleaner display in the meeting right side and PDF export: only Attended is shown (no more 'Invited' label).

[Learn more about meeting management with OpenProject](../../user-guide/meetings/#meeting-management).

### Synchronize group information / OIDC (Enterprise add-on)

OpenProject 16.4 introduces the ability to synchronize group memberships from your OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider. This makes it easier to manage user groups and permissions centrally in your identity provider. It ensures that group memberships in OpenProject reflect those settings whenever users log in.

Key capabilities include:

- Enable or disable group synchronization per OIDC provider.
- Filter which groups are imported, or extract specific substrings from group names.
- Automatically create groups in OpenProject if they do not yet exist.
- Distinguish between locally managed and synchronized memberships.
- Retain full administrative control to rename or delete synced groups and memberships.

This provides flexibility for organizations, especially when self-registration is enabled. Unlike LDAP synchronization, group updates are applied on login, giving admins full control over membership changes. [Read more about OIDC in our documentation](../../system-admin-guide/authentication/openid-providers/).

This feature was developed with the support of Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin.

### Improved budget handling in project queries and budget planning

With OpenProject 16.4, it is now easier to set up and track budgets. When creating a budget, you can now define a **Base amount** — a fixed sum of money — without having to plan material or labor costs in detail (though you still can if needed, of course). This makes it much faster to allocate lump sums, especially for high-level budgets.

In addition, **project lists** now include columns for planned budget, spent budget, spent percentage, and available budget, giving you a clearer overview across projects.

These updates make budgeting more practical for everyday use, and we will continue to expand budgets and cost management in future releases. [Read more about budgets in our user guide](../../user-guide/budgets/).

![Screenshot of OpenProject 16.4: New budget with highlighted Base amount](openproject-16-4-budgets-highlighted.png)

### Updated Home and Project overview page

OpenProject 16.4 introduces **UI improvements** to the existing widgets on the application home page and the Project overview page.

Changes include:

- Refreshed styling with white backgrounds in Light mode, rounded corners, and improved dark mode support.
- The **More (three dots) menu** is now always visible.
- The **add widgets** placeholder is easier to spot and clickable.
- A new **+ Widget button** in the subheader opens the widget selection modal, with new widgets placed at the top of the page.

These updates make widgets clearer and faster to use, while work continues on the upcoming Overview dashboard.

## Important technical updates

### SCIM improvements (Enterprise add-on)

The SCIM server functionality (Enterprise add-on) introduced in OpenProject 16.2 has been further improved in 16.4:

- **Deleted user status**: When a user is deleted via SCIM, their status is now set to deleted instead of locked. Deleted users no longer appear in queries, API v3, or the SCIM API, but remain visible in the admin user list until the deletion is complete.

- **ServiceProviderConfig endpoint**: The /scim_v2/ServiceProviderConfig endpoint now responds with limited output even without authorization, showing available authentication schemes. Full information is still only returned with valid authorization.

- **Clear error for insufficient plan**: If the Enterprise subscription level does not include SCIM, the server now returns a 403 Forbidden with a clear message instead of a generic 401 error.

These changes make SCIM integrations more robust and transparent, improving interoperability with identity providers. [Read more about SCIM provisioning in our documentation](../../system-admin-guide/authentication/scim/).
