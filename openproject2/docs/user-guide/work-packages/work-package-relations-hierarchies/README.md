# Work package relations and hierarchies

You can create work package relations and hierarchies.

Relations indicate any functional or timely relation (e.g. follows or proceeds, blocked by, part of, etc.). Hierarchies are a hierarchical relation (parent-child relationship).

## Work package relations

Work package relations indicate that work packages address a similar topic or create status dependencies. To create a relationship between two work packages:

1. Select a work package, click on **Relations** to open the *Relations* tab and click the **+ Relation**  button.
2. Select the type of relationship from the dropdown menu.
3. Enter the ID or name of the work package, to which the relation should be created. The autocomplete will suggest the work package to be added.
4. Enter a description of the relation. It will be visible for both of the related work packages.
5. Press the Enter key and click the **Save** button.

!["Add relations" button under Relations tab in an OpenProject work package](openproject_user_guide_wp_add_relations_button.png)

![Add a related work package in OpenProject](openproject_user_guide_wp_add_relations_form.png)

You can select one of the following relations:

- **Related to** - This option adds a link from the work package A to work package B, so that project members can immediately see the connection, even if the work packages are not members of the same hierarchy.

- **Predecessor (before)/ Successor (after)** - Defines a chronological relation between two work packages. For example, if you set a work package A to precede a work package B, the start date of B has to be at least a day after the finish date of A.
  Please note: If work package B is in [manual scheduling mode](../../gantt-chart/scheduling/#manual-scheduling), changing the finish date of work package A will have no effect on work package B.

> [!TIP]
> Prior to 15.1, *Predecessor (before)* was called *Precedes*, and *Successor (after)* was called *Follows*.

For the relations of type Predecessor/Successor, you can also define **lag**, which is the minimum number of working days to keep in between the two work packages. The default setting for lag is 0 working days. Lag can also be negative. Here are a few examples:

- A lag of 0 means the successor starts one working day after the predecessor finishes.
- A lag of 2 means the successor starts three working day after the predecessor finishes.
- A lag of -1 means the successor starts on the same day the predecessor finishes.
- A lag of -2 schedules the successor to start one working day before the predecessor finishes, and so on.

Only working days are considered when calculating lag. For example, if the predecessor finishes on a Wednesday and Saturday/Sunday are non-working days, then a lag of -3 schedules the successor to start on the previous Thursday.

You can always edit the *Description* and *Lag* fields at a later time.

![Add a successor work package in OpenProject](openproject_user_guide_relations_tab_edit_lag.png)

- **Create new child** - This option lets you create a new package and automatically adds it as a child to the current (parent) work package.

- **Child** - This option allows you to add an existing work package as a child to the current (parent) work package.

- **Parent**  - This option makes the related work package a parent of the current (child) work package.

- **Other relations** - Clicking *other relations* opens second level navigation with additional relations options. They include: 

- **Duplicates / Duplicated by** - This option indicates that the work package B duplicates a work package A in one way or another, for example both address the same task. This can be useful if you have the same work package that needs to be a part of a closed and public projects at the same time. The connection in this case is only semantic, the changes you make in work package A will need to be adapted in work package B manually.

> [!NOTE]
> Some changes in statuses will be adjusted automatically for the duplicated work package. Specifically, if the status of a work package A is set to be "closed" (or set to any status that is defined to count as "closed" in the  [system settings](../../../system-admin-guide/manage-work-packages/work-package-status/), for example "rejected" often counts as a "closed" status), the status of the work package B will change to "closed". Note that this is direction dependent. Only if the work package A is closed will the work package B be closed as well, not the other way around.

- **Blocks / Blocked by** - This option defines status change restrictions between two work packages. If you set a work package A to be blocking work package B, the status of work package B cannot be set to closed or resolved until the work package A is closed.

- **Includes / Part of** - Defines if work package A includes or is part of work package B. This relation type can be used for example when you have a roll-out work package and work packages which should be shown as included without using hierarchical relationships. There is no additional effect.

- **Requires / Required by** - Defines if work package A requires or is required by work package B. There is no additional effect.

> [!TIP]
> The selected relation status will be automatically displayed in the work package that you enter. For example if you select "Blocks" in the current work package A and specify work package B, work package B will automatically show that it is "Blocked by" A.

After adding related work packages, they are listed in the Relations tab. Related work packages are grouped by the type of relation into corresponding sections. The order of the sections matches the order of relation types in the drop-down menu of the +Relation button (i.e., relates to, predecessors, successors, etc.). The Children section is listed last. Within each section, the related work packages are ordered chronologically, based on when the relations were added.

### Moving related work packages

The predecessor/successor relation is the only one that can constrain or affect the dates of work packages.

In **automatic scheduling** mode, the successor is by default scheduled to start immediately after the predecessor finishes. You cannot move the predecessor freely without affecting the successor. If the predecessor is delayed, the successor will automatically be pushed into the future. To create a planned gap between them, you can apply a **lag** to the relation.

In **manual scheduling** mode, work packages in a predecessor/successor relationship will retain the relationship but can be individually free scheduled without constraint. A successor can even be moved such that it begins and ends _before_ a predecessor. 

## Display relations in a work package table (Enterprise add-on)

As a user of [Enterprise on-premises](https://www.openproject.org/enterprise-edition/) or [Enterprise cloud](https://www.openproject.org/enterprise-edition/#hosting-options) you can display relations as columns in the work package tables.

This is useful if you want to get an overview of certain types of relationships between work packages. You can for example see which work packages are blocking other work packages.

To add relation columns, navigate to the upper right corner of the work package table and click on the icon with the three dots.  Select **Insert columns** and type the name of the relation into the search bar. Then select the relation and click on apply.

![work package add relation as column](openproject_user_guide_wp_table_configuration.png)

The relations column shows the number of relations each work package has for the relation type (e.g. "blocked by").

You can click on the number to display the work packages which have the relation type.

## Work package hierarchies

Work packages can be structured hierarchically, e.g. in order to break down a large work package into several smaller tasks. This means that there's a parent work package that has at least one child work package.

## Add a child work package

There are **four ways to add or create a child work package**:

1. [Adding a child in the *Relations* tab in a work package's details view](#add-a-child-in-the-relations-tab-in-a-work-packages-details-view)

2. Right-clicking on a work package in the work package table and select "Create new child"

3. Right-clicking on a work package in the work package table and select "Indent hierarchy" to add it as the child of the work package above it.

   ![Add a child in a work package table](openproject_user_guide_wp_table_add_child.png)

4. You can add a child work package directly under the table of related work packages. To do that you first need to [include a table of related work packages to work package forms (Enterprise add-on)](../../../system-admin-guide/manage-work-packages/work-package-types/#add-table-of-related-work-packages-to-a-work-package-form-enterprise-add-on). 

   ![A table of related work packages in OpenProject](open_project_admin_related_wp_table.png)

### Add a child in the *Relations* tab in a work package's details view

Open a work package and select the tab *Relations*. Here you can click on *+ Relation* button, and select either *Create new child* or *Child* option to add a new or an existing work package as a child to the current one.

![Add a child to a work package in OpenProject](openproject_user_guide_wp_add_child.png)

Type the name of the new work package or select an existing one, then click the *Save* button. 

When creating a new work package as a child, you will be asked to select type, a subject and optionally add description text. If there are required fields for the type selected, they will also appear here.

![Create a new child work package under Relations tab in OpenProject](openproject_user_guide_wp_add_child_new.png)

![Select a child work package in OpenProject](openproject_user_guide_wp_add_child_select.png)

For more information on the work package creation take a look at the guideline on [creating a work package](../create-work-package).

> [!TIP]
>
> If children work packages already exist for the current work package, you can also use the **+Child** button in the header of the 'Children' section.

![Create child button under work package Relations tab in OpenProject](openproject_user_guide_wp_relations_child_button.png)

## Change the parent work package

To edit or remove the parent of a work package open the work package. At the top of the details view of the work package you will see the work package hierarchy. Click on the **edit icon** or **delete icon** to change the work package parent.

Alternatively you can select the **Delete relation** option next to the parent relation under *Relations* tab.

![change parent work package](openproject_user_guide_relations_change_parent.png)

## Display work package hierarchies

After adding the parent and child work packages they are listed in the *Relations* tab. Related work packages are grouped by the type of relation into respective sections. 

> [!TIP]
> Dates of the related work packages are only shown for date-based relations: children, predecessor and successor. 

![Work package relations displayed in the Relations tab in OpenProject](openproject_user_guide_wp_relations_tab_overview.png)

> [!NOTE]
> If you do not have necessary permissions (for example if only one specific work package was shared with you, but not the entire project), you will be able to see that a work package has a relation, and the dates of that related work package, but not other details of that related work package.

![Example of work package relations displayed under Relations tab for a user with limited permissions in OpenProject](openproject_user_guide_ghost_relations.png)

Hierarchies can also be displayed from the work package table view.
To display work package hierarchies make sure the *Subject* column is displayed. You can activate or deactivate the hierarchy by pressing the icon next to the Subject.

![User guide display hierarchy](openproject_user_guide_wp_hierarchy_icon.png)

You can also add a column with information about parent work packages:

1. Click on the gear wheel in the upper right corner of the work package table to open the work package table configuration.
2. Select "Parent" from the drop down menu and click on apply.
3. Now the column with the information about a parent relation is displayed in the work package table.

![Select parent as column in OpenProject work package tables](openproject_user_guide_wp_table_show_parent.png)

*Parent* column displays all direct children work packages. If you want to include all deeper hierarchy levels, i.e. include grandchildren and so on, use the **Descendants of** filter. Learn more about [filtering for descendants](../work-package-table-configuration/#filter-for-descendants-of-a-work-package).
